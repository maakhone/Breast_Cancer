This dataset contains 3 measures (mean, standard deviation, and worst) for 10 different cell features - radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
All these features have been computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass, and they describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
Diagnosis column represents whether the patient has benign tumor or malignant tumor.

This script compares some machine learning models and their accuracy on prediction of breast cancer
